### Android & WearOS application for Snore and Teeth Grinding Detection and Tracking 

**Tell us what your idea is.   
Describe in 250 words what the feature or service will do and how you’ll use Machine Learning to push the bar:**

*Snoring can create real problems in a marriage. Also obstructive sleep apnea (when breathing is disrupted during sleep for short periods), which increases the risk of developing heart disease.

Sleep apnea is manageable using several approaches including CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), oral appliance therapy and surgery.

Our solution is to use audio classification through deep learning to identify the type of snoring which can be highly useful for a targeted and thus successful medical treatment 
V – Velum (palate), including soft palate, uvula, lateral velopharyngeal walls
O – Oropharyngeal lateral walls, including palatine tonsils
T – Tongue, including tongue base and airway posterior to the tongue base
E – Epiglottis.

Using wearable such as Wear OS watch to nudge you when detect snoring or teeth grinding.

**Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life.   
Describe where your project is, how you could use Google’s help in the endeavor, and how you plan on using On-Device ML technology to bring the concept to life. The best submissions have a great idea combined with a concrete path of where you plan on going, which should include:**  
1. **any potential sample code you’ve already written,**
2. **a list of the ways you could use Google’s help,** 
3. **as well as the timeline on how you plan on bringing it to life by May 1, 2020.**

Following link shows the video I trained to classifed snoring. Currently it can accurately detect snoring and teethgrinding but not accurate to detect what kind of snoring it is.

**How Google could help us achieve the goal :**  
1. **Assign us a Mentor for the project**   
2. **Increase the classfication accuracy**  
3. **Work with Google Health Team**
4. **Integrate to Google Fit**
5. **Collect Data set for the project**  
<br/>

**Timeline:**
  
**By november 2019 :**
> Project structuring and setup  
> Android Application beta model  
> Research and Learning  
  
**December 2019:**
>Finalising the best possible method for the application  
>Data Acquiring and cleaning  
>Documenting and Training Models  
  
**January  2020:**
>Development and cloud integration
  
**February 2020 :**
>If we get selected. We want to focus and make our audio classification more accurate.
  
**March 2020 :**
>Testing and Beta Program
  
**April 2020 :**
>Testing and Deployment

**Tell us about you.  
A great idea is just one part of the equation; we also want to learn a bit more about you. Share with us some of your other projects so we can get an idea of how we can assist you with your project.**  
  
*Hello ! I am Ethan Fan Co-Founder of [Vimo Labs](https://www.vimo.co).  

Our wearable apps have been featured in Google I/O 2015 (Golf Swing Analyzer), Google Play Store, and Apple Watch App Store. I also used to work for Pebble and built some of the most popular app over there. The reason I want to join this challeange is because I want to use ML and Wearable to make people more healthy. We had done that through building Gymatic app which auto detect the exercise you did in the gym and count the reps for you. Detecting snoring and teeth grinding have a bigger market and will help more people which is what we want to work on next*
